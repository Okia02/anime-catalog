### Hi 👋🏽, I'm [Ana Jiménez](https://github.com/Okia02)

... and a junior developer who enjoys anime! 

**What is this web about?**

If you access here 💻 https://okia02.github.io/anime-catalog/, you'll find a huge catalog of anime where you search by name and save your favs for later. You can remove them one by one or all at the same time.
